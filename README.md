# STOCK-PRICE-PREDICTION-USING-TWITTER-DATASET
In this project, we apply sentiment analysis and machine learning principles to find the correlation between "public sentiment" and "market sentiment". We use twitter data to predict public mood and use the predicted mood and previous daysâ€™ DJIA values to predict the stock market movements and also predicting Stock Prices.
